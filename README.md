# YOLO Object Detection API with FastAPI, Nginx & Locust

This project provides a simple **object detection API** using [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) served with **FastAPI**.  
The app is containerized with **Docker** and uses **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.  
We also include **Locust** for load testing the deployed API.
